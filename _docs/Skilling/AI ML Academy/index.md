# AI & ML Academy

## Content

Welcome to the AI and ML Academy (AIA)! This academy includes 6 modules, all of which are built on top of each other. It incorporates technical assets as well as best practices. We include common AI/ML scenarios that we have seen throughout various industries. The objective of the academy is to help you move faster and build effective solutions. 
The structure of the content is represented in the table below. Each session contains one or more presentations -- with suggested labs and workshop content -- designed to accommodate various skill levels.
